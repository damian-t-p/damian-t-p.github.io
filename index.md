    I'm Damian, and I've recently completed my PhD at Stanford's Statistics department, where I was advised by <a href="https://imjohnstone.su.domains//">Iain Johnstone</a>.
    I am currently applying for jobs as a biostatistician, primarily in Melbourne, Australia.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am interested in problems of testing and estimation arising from high-dimensional statistics.
	My research has been focused on random matrix theory, and its applications to statistical methodology and high-dimenstional biological problems.
