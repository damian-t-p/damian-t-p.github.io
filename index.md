    I'm Damian, and I'm a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at the <a href="https://burnet.edu.au">Burnet Institute</a> in Melbourne Australia.
	
	I completed my PhD at Stanford's Statistics department in 2022, where I was advised by <a href="https://imjohnstone.su.domains//">Iain Johnstone</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am interested in applying modern statistical methods to data in the public health domain.
	I work on diverse projects, including the use of high-dimenstional statistics in the proteomics of people with HIV and longitudinal causal inference in long-term studies of housing and incarceration.
